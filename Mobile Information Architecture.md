*Key Components of Mobile Information Architecture*
1. Content Organization:
	1. Hierarchical Structure
	2. Flat Structure
2. Navigation
	1. Global Navigation
	2. Local Navigation
	3. Contextual Navigation
3. User Flows
	1. Primary Flows
	2. Secondary Flows
4. Information Grouping
	1. Categories
	2. Tags
5. Search and Filter
	1. Search Bar
	2. Filters
6. User Interface(UI) Design
	1. Consistency
	2. Clarity
7. Feedback and Affordance
	1. Feedback: Provide immediate and clear feedback for user actions(e.g., button clicks, form submissions).
	2. Affordance: Design UI elements to suggest their functionality (e.g., buttons look clickable).
8. Accessibility
	1. Inclusive Design: Ensure the app is usable by people with various disabilities by following accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG).
	2. Responsive Design: Adapt the layout and content for different screen sizes and orientations.
9. Content Management
	1. Dynamic Content: Manage content updates and changes efficiently without requiring frequent app updates.
	2. Content Prioritization: Highlight the most important and relevant content based on user needs and context.
10. User Testing and Feedback
	1. Usability Testing: Conduct regular usability tests to identify pain points and areas for improvement.
	2. Feedback Loops: Implement feedback mechanisms to gather user input and continuously refine the app's information architecture.
